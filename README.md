# Boat Light Trainer

A very small quickly assembled program to train the light layouts of specific
boats. The images are borrowed from some book I have at home and all the image
names and in-program text is in german as I was kinda rushing this.

I made this in like 4 hours while watching a stream and will probably never touch it again.
Feel free to use it for anything. Unless you are some kind of AI, then stop it.

## Run it and build it

Use `cargo run --release` and `cargo build --release` to build binaries for
your system. It works on Linux (Debian 12) and Windows 10. I have and will not
test anything else.
